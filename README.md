# Heart Attack Prediction Model
Heart disease remains a major global health concern, being one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. This project aims to develop a predictive model to assess the risk of heart attacks based on various demographic and clinical attributes.
## Objective

The primary goal of this study is to identify the best model for predicting whether an individual is likely to experience a heart attack. We will analyze a range of variables, including:

 Age
    Sex
    Chest pain type
    Cholesterol levels
    Blood pressure
    Other relevant health indicators

By examining these attributes, we seek actionable insights to improve risk assessment and intervention strategies.
Methodology

## Data Collection: We will gather datasets containing demographic and clinical information relevant to heart disease.
    Data Preprocessing: This includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and normalizing data formats.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We will explore relationships and patterns among variables to inform model selection.
    Model Development: Various machine learning algorithms will be implemented and compared, focusing on:
        Accuracy
        Sensitivity
        Specificity
        Predictive power
    Model Evaluation: The performance of each model will be evaluated using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.

## Expected Outcomes

The insights gained from this research will:

Enhance understanding of heart disease risk factors.
    Inform healthcare practitioners about high-risk individuals.
    Lead to tailored intervention strategies and preventive measures.
    Support informed decision-making based on data-driven risk assessments.
